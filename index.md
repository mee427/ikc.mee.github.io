Design requirements of the course can be found [here.](https://github.com/mee427/mee427.github.io/blob/master/Requirements.pdf)

You can reach the [h-bridge](https://github.com/mee427/circuits/blob/master/H_bridge.PNG), [rotational velocity feedback](https://github.com/mee427/circuits/blob/master/Rotational%20Velocity%20Feedback.PNG) and [current feedback](https://github.com/mee427/circuits/blob/master/Current%20Feedback.PNG) circuits

You can reach the example ccs c codes for [analog reading](https://github.com/mee427/ccs-c-codes/blob/master/AnalogRead.c), [constant pwm output](https://github.com/mee427/ccs-c-codes/blob/master/ConstantPwmOut.c) and [serial communication with debounce](https://github.com/mee427/ccs-c-codes/blob/master/SerialDebounce.c). Serial to PWM signal code is also uploaded to [here.](https://github.com/mee427/ccs-c-codes/blob/master/ReadStringToPwm.c)
