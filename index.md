Student list for calibration procedure can be founded [here.](https://github.com/mee427/mee427.github.io/blob/master/liste_mee427.pdf)
Electronic cards should work properly by means of reading analog input, digital output, pwm output as well as the serial communication (rx  tx) at the lab on 09/10/2019.
Students should bring computer to the lab in order to upload the code pieces into the microcontrollers. For the communication interface between the computer and the microcontroller, it is possible to use arduino uno without its microchip on it (as if it is a ftdi chip). You can reach the example codes below on this page.
